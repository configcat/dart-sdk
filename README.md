ConfigCat SDK for Dart provides easy integration for your application to ConfigCat.

ConfigCat is a feature flag and configuration management service that lets you separate feature releases from code deployments. You can turn features ON or OFF using the <a href="https://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a> even after they are deployed. ConfigCat lets you target specific groups of users based on region, email, or any other custom user attribute.

ConfigCat is a <a href="https://configcat.com" target="_blank">hosted feature flag service</a> that lets you manage feature toggles across frontend, backend, mobile, and desktop apps. <a href="https://configcat.com" target="_blank">Alternative to LaunchDarkly</a>. Management app + feature flag SDKs.

## Getting started

### 1. Install the ConfigCat SDK
With Dart:
```bash
dart pub add configcat_client
```
With Flutter:
```bash
flutter pub add configcat_client
```
Or put the following directly to your `pubspec.yml` and run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get`.
```yaml
dependencies:
  configcat_client: ^2.4.0
```

### 2. Go to the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/sdkkey" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a> to get your *SDK Key*:
![SDK-KEY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConfigCat/dart-sdk/master/media/readme02-3.png  "SDK-KEY")

### 3. Import the *configcat_client* package in your application code
```dart
import 'package:configcat_client/configcat_client.dart';
```

### 4. Create a *ConfigCat* client instance
```dart
final client = ConfigCatClient.get(sdkKey: '#YOUR-SDK-KEY#');
```

### 5. Get your setting value
```dart
final isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = await client.getValue(key: 'isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled', defaultValue: false);
if (isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) {
    doTheNewThing();
} else {
    doTheOldThing();
}
```
### 6. Close the client on application exit
```dart
client.close();
```

## Getting user-specific setting values with Targeting
Using this feature, you will be able to get different setting values for different users in your application by passing a `User Object` to the `getValue()` function.

Read more about Targeting [here](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/).


## User Object
Percentage and targeted rollouts are calculated by the user object passed to the configuration requests.
The user object must be created with a **mandatory** identifier parameter which uniquely identifies each user:
```dart
final user = ConfigCatUser(identifier: '#USER-IDENTIFIER#');

final isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = await client.getValue(key: 'isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled', defaultValue: false, user: user);
if (isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) {
  doTheNewThing();
} else {
  doTheOldThing();
}
```

## Polling Modes
The ConfigCat SDK supports three different polling mechanisms to acquire the setting values from ConfigCat. After the latest setting values are downloaded, they are stored in an internal cache . After that, all requests are served from the cache. Read more about Polling Modes and how to use them at [ConfigCat Dart Docs](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/dart/).
